    "note": "“The Dream Cycle is a series of short stories and novellas by author H. P. Lovecraft (1890–1937). Written between 1918 and 1932, they are about the 'Dreamlands', a vast alternate dimension that can only be entered via dreams. The Dreamlands are described as lying deeper than space, matter and time, and are a 'limitless vacua beyond all thought and entity'.”\n\nSource: Wikipedia — https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dream_Cycle\n\n© Color map by Jason Thompson (2012) — https://mockman.com/",
